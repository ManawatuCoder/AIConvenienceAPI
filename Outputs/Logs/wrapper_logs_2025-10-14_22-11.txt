Prompt 1: Method and Guideline Analysis
================================================================================

Context: You are analyzing the attached codegen methods from a client class, along with a list of Java Azure SDK Design Guidelines headers.

Your tasks:
1. Identify potential patterns across these methods that could be optimized to improve developer experience 
   (e.g. similar operations that could be combined, consistent parameter patterns, repetitive return processing, 
   avoiding low-level data types like byte streams).
2. From the list of guideline headers, select which guidelines are most relevant to the identified methods.

Instructions:
- Only consider patterns relevant to developer convenience. Ignore low-level protocol details.
- Evaluate whether there is any true convenience to be added.
- You will generate wrappers over multiple requests, so any methods you wish to wrap together should be grouped together in your response.
- Each group will be sent as its own prompt alongside the entire list of requested guidelines; Large grouping is acceptable, and can be desireable for reduced LLM costs.
- Duplicates methods through groups are undesireable; Coallescing of groups is preferred to duplicate methods.
- Duplicate guidelines are completely acceptable, it is desired that you have what you need to output quality.
- If no patterns are found, return only the string "no".
- If patterns are found, return a JSON object in the format:

[
  {
    "methods": ["foo", "bar", ...],
    "guidelines": ["Header 1", "Header 3", ...]
  },
  {
    "methods": ["foobar", "baz", ...],
    "guidelines": ["Header 2", "Header 3", ...]
  },
  ...
]

Notes:
- Do NOT include any explanations or commentary.
- Do not put generated code into a class. You must only return the names as requested.
- If there is no real convenience to be added, ignore all steps and return only the word "no".

Method names:
```
[listDatasetVersions(, pendingUploadWithResponse(, getDatasetVersion(, getDatasetVersionWithResponse(, pendingUpload(, createDatasetWithFile(, createDatasetWithFolder(, deleteDatasetVersionWithResponse(, createOrUpdateDatasetVersionWithResponse(, deleteDatasetVersion(, listLatestDatasetVersions(, createOrUpdateDatasetVersion(, getCredentialsWithResponse(, getCredentials(]

Prompt 2: Convenience Wrapper Generation
================================================================================

Context: The following Java SDK methods were flagged as potential candidates for generating convenience wrappers. The accompanying design guidelines outline desired principles for improving developer experience.

Your task:
Your goal is to think like an SDK designer, not a refactorer.
Analyse the methods and guidelines to identify high-level developer goals or workflows that are currently too low-level or fragmented.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand developer intent:
- What real-world task or developer workflow does this SDK enable?
- What steps would a developer typically need to perform manually?
2. Identify friction points:
- Are there repetitive setup steps, parameter redundancies, or multi-call workflows that could be hidden or automated?
3. Design potential convenience wrappers that:
- Represent meaningful user tasks.
- Eliminate multiple low-level method calls or configuration steps.
- Provide sensible defaults or intelligent handling for common cases.
4. Reject shallow wrappers.
- Do NOT propose wrappers that only merge 2-3 existing methods, unless they significantly improve clarity or hide complex logic.
5.  Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped, and the reason for wrapping.

Output format:
/**
 * {Brief JavaDoc summary of code.}
 */
public void exampleWrapper() {
    /*
      Combined Methods: methodOne, methodTwo, etc.
      Reason: Explain why this wrapper improves developer experience
    */
    // Code here
}


Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Make sure that the 'Combined Methods' and 'Reason' comments are in block comments inside of the method, NOT in the Javadocs comment.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
- Quality over quantity. Avoid creating wrapper methods for the sake of it. All wrappers must be justified
- Output the code as raw text. Do NOT put it in a code block with backticks

Methods:
```

```
Design Guidelines:
"""
Service Methods
Service methods are methods that invoke operations on a service. They are commonly found on classes suffixed with Client, but can also be found on other resource classes that are vended by a client.
⛔️ DO NOT use the suffix Async in methods that do operations asynchronously. Let the fact the user has an instance of an ‘async client’ provide this context.
✅ DO prefer the use of the following terms for CRUD operations:
Verb Parameters Returns Comments upsert<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services. set<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service. create<noun> key, item Created item Create new item. Fails if item already exists. update<noun> key, partial item Updated item Fails if item doesn’t exist. replace<noun> key, item Replace existing item Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn’t exist. delete<noun> key Deleted item, or null Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn’t exist. Deleted item may be returned, if service supports it. add<noun> index, item Added item Add item to a collection. Item will be added last, or into the index position specified. get<noun> key Item Will return null if item doesn’t exist. list<noun> Items Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist. <noun>Exists key boolean Return true if the item exists.
☑️ YOU SHOULD remain flexible and use names best suited for developer experience. Don’t let the naming rules result in non-idiomatic naming patterns. For example, Java developers prefer list operations over getAll operations.
One of the Azure Core types is com.azure.core.util.Context, which acts as an append-only key-value map, and which by default is empty. The Context allows end users of the API to modify the outgoing requests to Azure on a per-method call basis, for example to enable distributed tracing.
✅ DO provide an overload method that takes a com.azure.core.util.Context argument for each service operation in sync clients only. The Context argument must be the last argument into the service method (except where varargs are used). If a service method has multiple overloads, only the ‘maximal’ overloads need to have the Context argument. A maximal overload is one that has a full set of arguments. It may not be necessary to offer a ‘Context overload’ in all cases. We prefer a minimal API surface, but Context must always be supported.
getFoo()
getFoo(x)
getFoo(x, y)
getFoo(x, y, z) // maximal overload
getFoo(a)       // maximal overload

// this will result in the following two methods being required
// (replacing the two maximal overloads above)
getFoo(x, y, z, Context)
getFoo(a, Context)
⛔️ DO NOT include overloads that take Context in async clients. Async clients use the subscriber context built into Reactor Flux and Mono APIs.

Naming Patterns
Using a consistent set of naming patterns across all client libraries will ensure a consistent and more intuitive developer experience. This section outlines good practices for naming that must be followed by all client libraries.
✅ DO prefer succinctness over verbosity in method and class names, except when readability is impacted. A few examples include:
A class may want to return an identifier to a user. There is no additional value in the fully-qualified getIdentifier() compared with the shorter and equally-descriptive getId(). A method called getName() is short, but may leave some doubt in the users mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method getLinkName() will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of getId() above, always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use getTenantId() rather than getId(), unless it is completely unambiguous as to which identifier is being referenced.
⛔️ DO NOT fully uppercase acronyms. APIs must take the form of getHttpConnection() or getUrlName() rather than getHTTPConnection() or getURLName().
✅ DO use service-specific acronyms sparingly in API. Whereas most users will accept a method including Http or Url in the name, most users will not know what Sas or Cpk mean. Where possible (without breaking the succinctness over verbosity requirement above), expansion of acronyms, or at the very least sufficient documentation at class and method levels to describe the acronym, must be considered.
✅ DO use the correct naming for ‘host’ vs ‘hostname’. ‘hostname’ is the host name without any port number, whereas ‘host’ is the hostname with the port number.
⛔️ DO NOT use camel case on words that are commonly accepted in their combined form. For example, ‘hostname’ should be spelt as hostname rather than hostName, and ‘username’ should be spelt as username rather than userName.
⛔️ DO NOT name interface types with an ‘I’ prefix, e.g. ISearchClient. Instead, do not have any prefix for an interface, preferring SearchClient as the name for the interface type in this case.

Methods Returning Collections (Paging)
Many Azure REST APIs return collections of data in batches or pages. A client library will expose such APIs as special enumerable types PagedIterable<T> or PagedFlux<T> (or one of their parent types), for synchronous and asynchronous APIs, respectively. These types are located in the azure-core library.
✅ DO return PagedIterable<T> from service methods in synchronous that return a collection of items. For example, the configuration service sync client should offer the following API:
public final class ConfigurationClient {
    // synchronous API returning a PagedIterable of ConfigurationSetting instances
    public PagedIterable<ConfigurationSetting> listSettings(...) {
        ...
    }
}
PagedIterable allows developers to write code that works using the standard for loop syntax (as it is an Iterable), and also to work with a Java Stream (as there is a stream() method). Consumers may also call streamByPage() and iterableByPage() methods to work on page boundaries. Subclasses of these types are acceptable as return types too, so long as the naming convention generally follows the pattern <serviceName>PagedIterable or <operation>PagedFlux.
⛔️ DO NOT return other collection types for sync APIs that return collections (for example, do not return List, Stream, Iterable, or Iterator).
✅ DO return PagedFlux<T> (or an appropriately-named subclass) for asynchronous APIs that expose a collection of items. Even if the service does not support pagination, always return PagedFlux<T>, as it allows for consumers to retrieve response information in a consistent manner.
public final class ConfigurationAsyncClient {

    // asynchronous API returning a PagedFlux of ConfigurationSetting instances
    public PagedFlux<ConfigurationSetting> listSettings(SettingSelector options, Context context) {
        // The first lambda is a Supplier<PagedResponse<T>> returning the first page of results
        // as a Mono<PagedResponse<T>>.
        // The second lambda is a Function<String, Mono<PagedResponse<T>>>, returning a
        // Mono<PagedResponse<T>> representing a page based on the provided continuationToken.
        return new PagedFlux<>(
            () -> listFirstPageSettings(options, context),
            continuationToken -> listNextPageSettings(contextWithSpanName, continuationToken));
    }
}
Consumers of this API can consume individual items by treating the response as a Flux<T>:
client.listSettings(..)
      .subscribe(item -> System.out.println("Processing item " + item));
The consumer may process items page-by-page instead:
client.listSettings(..)
      .byPage()
      .subscribe(page -> {
        // page is a PagedResponse, which implements Page and Response, so there exists:
        //  * List<T> of items,
        //  * continuationToken (represented as a String),
        //  * Status code,
        //  * HTTP headers,
        //  * HTTP request
        System.out.println("Processing page " + page)
});
The PagedFlux.byPage() offers an overload to accept a continuationToken string, which will begin the returned Flux at the page specified by this token.
✔️ YOU MAY subclass the azure-core paged and iterable APIs, where appropriate, to offer additional, service specific API to users. If this is done, the subtype must be named as it currently is, prefixed with the name of the service. For example, SearchPagedFlux and SearchPagedIterable. Subtypes are expected to be placed within a util package existing within the root package.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.

```
Design Guidelines:
"""
Option Parameters
Service methods fall into two main groups when it comes to the number and complexity of parameters they accept:
Service Methods with simple inputs, simple methods for short Service Methods with complex inputs, complex methods for short
Simple methods are methods that take up to six parameters, with most of the parameters being simple primitive types. Complex methods are methods that take a larger number of parameters and typically correspond to REST APIs with complex request payloads.
Simple methods should follow standard Java best practices for parameter list and overload design.
Complex methods should introduce an option parameter to represent the request payload. Consideration can subsequently be made for providing simpler convenience overloads for the most common scenarios. This is referred to in this document as the ‘options pattern’, and is demonstrated in the code below:
public class BlobContainerClient {

    // simple service methods
    public BlobInfo uploadBlob(String blobName, byte[] content);
    public Response<BlobInfo> uploadBlobWithResponse(String blobName, byte[] content, Context context);

    // complex service methods, note the introduction of the 'CreateBlobOptions' type
    public BlobInfo createBlob(CreateBlobOptions options);
    public Response<BlobInfo> createBlobWithResponse(CreateBlobOptions options, Context context);

    // convenience overload[s]
    public BlobInfo createBlob(String blobName);
}

@Fluent
public class CreateBlobOptions {
    private String blobName;
    private PublicAccessType access;
    private Map<String, String> metadata;

    // Constructor enforces the requirement that blobName is always set
    public CreateBlobOptions(String blobName) {
        this.blobName = blobName;
    }

    public String getBlobName() {
        return blobName;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setAccess(PublicAccessType access) {
        this.access = access;
        return this;
    }

    public PublicAccessType getAccess() {
        return access;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setMetadata(Map<String, String> metadata) {
        this.metadata = metadata;
        return this;
    }

    public Map<String, String> getMetadata() {
        return metadata;
    }
}
✅ DO name the options type after the name of the service method it is used for, such that the type is named <operation>Options. For example, above the method was createBlob, and so the options type was named CreateBlobOptions.
✅ DO use the options parameter pattern for complex service methods.
✔️ YOU MAY use the options parameter pattern for simple service methods that you expect to grow in the future.
✔️ YOU MAY add simple overloads of methods using the options parameter pattern.
If in common scenarios, users are likely to pass just a small subset of what the options parameter represents, consider adding an overload with a parameter list representing just this subset.
⛔️ DO NOT introduce method overloads that take a subset of the parameters as well as the options parameter, except for parameters that are for client-side use only (e.g. Context, timeout, etc).
✅ DO use the options parameter type, if it exists, for all *WithResponse methods. If no options parameter type exists, do not create one solely for the *WithResponse method.
✅ DO place all options types in a root-level models package, to prevent too many root-level packages and to make use of the existing models package used by other model types.
✅ DO design options types with the same design guidance as given below for model class types, namely fluent setters for optional arguments, using the standard JavaBean naming convention of get*, set*, and is*. Additionally, there may be constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments.
✔️ YOU MAY introduce constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments (in a similar manner to required properties on model types).

Service Methods
Service methods are methods that invoke operations on a service. They are commonly found on classes suffixed with Client, but can also be found on other resource classes that are vended by a client.
⛔️ DO NOT use the suffix Async in methods that do operations asynchronously. Let the fact the user has an instance of an ‘async client’ provide this context.
✅ DO prefer the use of the following terms for CRUD operations:
Verb Parameters Returns Comments upsert<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services. set<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service. create<noun> key, item Created item Create new item. Fails if item already exists. update<noun> key, partial item Updated item Fails if item doesn’t exist. replace<noun> key, item Replace existing item Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn’t exist. delete<noun> key Deleted item, or null Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn’t exist. Deleted item may be returned, if service supports it. add<noun> index, item Added item Add item to a collection. Item will be added last, or into the index position specified. get<noun> key Item Will return null if item doesn’t exist. list<noun> Items Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist. <noun>Exists key boolean Return true if the item exists.
☑️ YOU SHOULD remain flexible and use names best suited for developer experience. Don’t let the naming rules result in non-idiomatic naming patterns. For example, Java developers prefer list operations over getAll operations.
One of the Azure Core types is com.azure.core.util.Context, which acts as an append-only key-value map, and which by default is empty. The Context allows end users of the API to modify the outgoing requests to Azure on a per-method call basis, for example to enable distributed tracing.
✅ DO provide an overload method that takes a com.azure.core.util.Context argument for each service operation in sync clients only. The Context argument must be the last argument into the service method (except where varargs are used). If a service method has multiple overloads, only the ‘maximal’ overloads need to have the Context argument. A maximal overload is one that has a full set of arguments. It may not be necessary to offer a ‘Context overload’ in all cases. We prefer a minimal API surface, but Context must always be supported.
getFoo()
getFoo(x)
getFoo(x, y)
getFoo(x, y, z) // maximal overload
getFoo(a)       // maximal overload

// this will result in the following two methods being required
// (replacing the two maximal overloads above)
getFoo(x, y, z, Context)
getFoo(a, Context)
⛔️ DO NOT include overloads that take Context in async clients. Async clients use the subscriber context built into Reactor Flux and Mono APIs.

Naming Patterns
Using a consistent set of naming patterns across all client libraries will ensure a consistent and more intuitive developer experience. This section outlines good practices for naming that must be followed by all client libraries.
✅ DO prefer succinctness over verbosity in method and class names, except when readability is impacted. A few examples include:
A class may want to return an identifier to a user. There is no additional value in the fully-qualified getIdentifier() compared with the shorter and equally-descriptive getId(). A method called getName() is short, but may leave some doubt in the users mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method getLinkName() will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of getId() above, always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use getTenantId() rather than getId(), unless it is completely unambiguous as to which identifier is being referenced.
⛔️ DO NOT fully uppercase acronyms. APIs must take the form of getHttpConnection() or getUrlName() rather than getHTTPConnection() or getURLName().
✅ DO use service-specific acronyms sparingly in API. Whereas most users will accept a method including Http or Url in the name, most users will not know what Sas or Cpk mean. Where possible (without breaking the succinctness over verbosity requirement above), expansion of acronyms, or at the very least sufficient documentation at class and method levels to describe the acronym, must be considered.
✅ DO use the correct naming for ‘host’ vs ‘hostname’. ‘hostname’ is the host name without any port number, whereas ‘host’ is the hostname with the port number.
⛔️ DO NOT use camel case on words that are commonly accepted in their combined form. For example, ‘hostname’ should be spelt as hostname rather than hostName, and ‘username’ should be spelt as username rather than userName.
⛔️ DO NOT name interface types with an ‘I’ prefix, e.g. ISearchClient. Instead, do not have any prefix for an interface, preferring SearchClient as the name for the interface type in this case.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.

Prompt 2: Convenience Wrapper Generation
================================================================================

Context: The following Java SDK methods were flagged as potential candidates for generating convenience wrappers. The accompanying design guidelines outline desired principles for improving developer experience.

Your task:
Your goal is to think like an SDK designer, not a refactorer.
Analyse the methods and guidelines to identify high-level developer goals or workflows that are currently too low-level or fragmented.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand developer intent:
- What real-world task or developer workflow does this SDK enable?
- What steps would a developer typically need to perform manually?
2. Identify friction points:
- Are there repetitive setup steps, parameter redundancies, or multi-call workflows that could be hidden or automated?
3. Design potential convenience wrappers that:
- Represent meaningful user tasks.
- Eliminate multiple low-level method calls or configuration steps.
- Provide sensible defaults or intelligent handling for common cases.
4. Reject shallow wrappers.
- Do NOT propose wrappers that only merge 2-3 existing methods, unless they significantly improve clarity or hide complex logic.
5.  Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped, and the reason for wrapping.

Output format:
/**
 * {Brief JavaDoc summary of code.}
 */
public void exampleWrapper() {
    /*
      Combined Methods: methodOne, methodTwo, etc.
      Reason: Explain why this wrapper improves developer experience
    */
    // Code here
}


Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Make sure that the 'Combined Methods' and 'Reason' comments are in block comments inside of the method, NOT in the Javadocs comment.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
- Quality over quantity. Avoid creating wrapper methods for the sake of it. All wrappers must be justified
- Output the code as raw text. Do NOT put it in a code block with backticks

Parameter Validation
The service client will have methods that send requests to the service. These methods take two kinds of parameters: service parameters and client parameters. Service parameters are sent across the wire to the service as URL segments, query parameters, request header values, and request bodies (typically JSON or XML). Client parameters are used solely within the client library and are not sent to the service; examples are path parameters, Context or file paths. If, for example, a path parameter is not validated, it could result in sending a request to a malformed URL, which could prevent the service from having the opportunity to do validation on it.
✅ DO validate client parameters. This includes checks for null values for required path parameters, and checks for empty string values if a required path parameter declares a minLength greater than zero.
⛔️ DO NOT validate service parameters. This includes null checks, empty strings, and other common validating conditions. Let the service validate any request parameters.
✅ DO test the developer experience when invalid service parameters are passed in. Ensure clear error messages are generated by the service. If the developer experience is inadequate, work with the service team to correct the problem.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.

Prompt 2: Convenience Wrapper Generation
================================================================================

Context: The following Java SDK methods were flagged as potential candidates for generating convenience wrappers. The accompanying design guidelines outline desired principles for improving developer experience.

Your task:
Your goal is to think like an SDK designer, not a refactorer.
Analyse the methods and guidelines to identify high-level developer goals or workflows that are currently too low-level or fragmented.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand developer intent:
- What real-world task or developer workflow does this SDK enable?
- What steps would a developer typically need to perform manually?
2. Identify friction points:
- Are there repetitive setup steps, parameter redundancies, or multi-call workflows that could be hidden or automated?
3. Design potential convenience wrappers that:
- Represent meaningful user tasks.
- Eliminate multiple low-level method calls or configuration steps.
- Provide sensible defaults or intelligent handling for common cases.
4. Reject shallow wrappers.
- Do NOT propose wrappers that only merge 2-3 existing methods, unless they significantly improve clarity or hide complex logic.
5.  Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped, and the reason for wrapping.

Output format:
/**
 * {Brief JavaDoc summary of code.}
 */
public void exampleWrapper() {
    /*
      Combined Methods: methodOne, methodTwo, etc.
      Reason: Explain why this wrapper improves developer experience
    */
    // Code here
}


Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Make sure that the 'Combined Methods' and 'Reason' comments are in block comments inside of the method, NOT in the Javadocs comment.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
- Quality over quantity. Avoid creating wrapper methods for the sake of it. All wrappers must be justified
- Output the code as raw text. Do NOT put it in a code block with backticks

    }



```
Design Guidelines:
"""
Option Parameters
Service methods fall into two main groups when it comes to the number and complexity of parameters they accept:
Service Methods with simple inputs, simple methods for short Service Methods with complex inputs, complex methods for short
Simple methods are methods that take up to six parameters, with most of the parameters being simple primitive types. Complex methods are methods that take a larger number of parameters and typically correspond to REST APIs with complex request payloads.
Simple methods should follow standard Java best practices for parameter list and overload design.
Complex methods should introduce an option parameter to represent the request payload. Consideration can subsequently be made for providing simpler convenience overloads for the most common scenarios. This is referred to in this document as the ‘options pattern’, and is demonstrated in the code below:
public class BlobContainerClient {

    // simple service methods
    public BlobInfo uploadBlob(String blobName, byte[] content);
    public Response<BlobInfo> uploadBlobWithResponse(String blobName, byte[] content, Context context);

    // complex service methods, note the introduction of the 'CreateBlobOptions' type
    public BlobInfo createBlob(CreateBlobOptions options);
    public Response<BlobInfo> createBlobWithResponse(CreateBlobOptions options, Context context);

    // convenience overload[s]
    public BlobInfo createBlob(String blobName);
}

@Fluent
public class CreateBlobOptions {
    private String blobName;
    private PublicAccessType access;
    private Map<String, String> metadata;

    // Constructor enforces the requirement that blobName is always set
    public CreateBlobOptions(String blobName) {
        this.blobName = blobName;
    }

    public String getBlobName() {
        return blobName;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setAccess(PublicAccessType access) {
        this.access = access;
        return this;
    }

    public PublicAccessType getAccess() {
        return access;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setMetadata(Map<String, String> metadata) {
        this.metadata = metadata;
        return this;
    }

    public Map<String, String> getMetadata() {
        return metadata;
    }
}
✅ DO name the options type after the name of the service method it is used for, such that the type is named <operation>Options. For example, above the method was createBlob, and so the options type was named CreateBlobOptions.
✅ DO use the options parameter pattern for complex service methods.
✔️ YOU MAY use the options parameter pattern for simple service methods that you expect to grow in the future.
✔️ YOU MAY add simple overloads of methods using the options parameter pattern.
If in common scenarios, users are likely to pass just a small subset of what the options parameter represents, consider adding an overload with a parameter list representing just this subset.
⛔️ DO NOT introduce method overloads that take a subset of the parameters as well as the options parameter, except for parameters that are for client-side use only (e.g. Context, timeout, etc).
✅ DO use the options parameter type, if it exists, for all *WithResponse methods. If no options parameter type exists, do not create one solely for the *WithResponse method.
✅ DO place all options types in a root-level models package, to prevent too many root-level packages and to make use of the existing models package used by other model types.
✅ DO design options types with the same design guidance as given below for model class types, namely fluent setters for optional arguments, using the standard JavaBean naming convention of get*, set*, and is*. Additionally, there may be constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments.
✔️ YOU MAY introduce constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments (in a similar manner to required properties on model types).

Service Methods
Service methods are methods that invoke operations on a service. They are commonly found on classes suffixed with Client, but can also be found on other resource classes that are vended by a client.
⛔️ DO NOT use the suffix Async in methods that do operations asynchronously. Let the fact the user has an instance of an ‘async client’ provide this context.
✅ DO prefer the use of the following terms for CRUD operations:
Verb Parameters Returns Comments upsert<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services. set<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service. create<noun> key, item Created item Create new item. Fails if item already exists. update<noun> key, partial item Updated item Fails if item doesn’t exist. replace<noun> key, item Replace existing item Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn’t exist. delete<noun> key Deleted item, or null Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn’t exist. Deleted item may be returned, if service supports it. add<noun> index, item Added item Add item to a collection. Item will be added last, or into the index position specified. get<noun> key Item Will return null if item doesn’t exist. list<noun> Items Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist. <noun>Exists key boolean Return true if the item exists.
☑️ YOU SHOULD remain flexible and use names best suited for developer experience. Don’t let the naming rules result in non-idiomatic naming patterns. For example, Java developers prefer list operations over getAll operations.
One of the Azure Core types is com.azure.core.util.Context, which acts as an append-only key-value map, and which by default is empty. The Context allows end users of the API to modify the outgoing requests to Azure on a per-method call basis, for example to enable distributed tracing.
✅ DO provide an overload method that takes a com.azure.core.util.Context argument for each service operation in sync clients only. The Context argument must be the last argument into the service method (except where varargs are used). If a service method has multiple overloads, only the ‘maximal’ overloads need to have the Context argument. A maximal overload is one that has a full set of arguments. It may not be necessary to offer a ‘Context overload’ in all cases. We prefer a minimal API surface, but Context must always be supported.
getFoo()
getFoo(x)
getFoo(x, y)
getFoo(x, y, z) // maximal overload
getFoo(a)       // maximal overload

// this will result in the following two methods being required
// (replacing the two maximal overloads above)
getFoo(x, y, z, Context)
getFoo(a, Context)
⛔️ DO NOT include overloads that take Context in async clients. Async clients use the subscriber context built into Reactor Flux and Mono APIs.

Naming Patterns
Using a consistent set of naming patterns across all client libraries will ensure a consistent and more intuitive developer experience. This section outlines good practices for naming that must be followed by all client libraries.
✅ DO prefer succinctness over verbosity in method and class names, except when readability is impacted. A few examples include:
A class may want to return an identifier to a user. There is no additional value in the fully-qualified getIdentifier() compared with the shorter and equally-descriptive getId(). A method called getName() is short, but may leave some doubt in the users mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method getLinkName() will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of getId() above, always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use getTenantId() rather than getId(), unless it is completely unambiguous as to which identifier is being referenced.
⛔️ DO NOT fully uppercase acronyms. APIs must take the form of getHttpConnection() or getUrlName() rather than getHTTPConnection() or getURLName().
✅ DO use service-specific acronyms sparingly in API. Whereas most users will accept a method including Http or Url in the name, most users will not know what Sas or Cpk mean. Where possible (without breaking the succinctness over verbosity requirement above), expansion of acronyms, or at the very least sufficient documentation at class and method levels to describe the acronym, must be considered.
✅ DO use the correct naming for ‘host’ vs ‘hostname’. ‘hostname’ is the host name without any port number, whereas ‘host’ is the hostname with the port number.
⛔️ DO NOT use camel case on words that are commonly accepted in their combined form. For example, ‘hostname’ should be spelt as hostname rather than hostName, and ‘username’ should be spelt as username rather than userName.
⛔️ DO NOT name interface types with an ‘I’ prefix, e.g. ISearchClient. Instead, do not have any prefix for an interface, preferring SearchClient as the name for the interface type in this case.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.

Design Guidelines:
"""
Option Parameters
Service methods fall into two main groups when it comes to the number and complexity of parameters they accept:
Service Methods with simple inputs, simple methods for short Service Methods with complex inputs, complex methods for short
Simple methods are methods that take up to six parameters, with most of the parameters being simple primitive types. Complex methods are methods that take a larger number of parameters and typically correspond to REST APIs with complex request payloads.
Simple methods should follow standard Java best practices for parameter list and overload design.
Complex methods should introduce an option parameter to represent the request payload. Consideration can subsequently be made for providing simpler convenience overloads for the most common scenarios. This is referred to in this document as the ‘options pattern’, and is demonstrated in the code below:
public class BlobContainerClient {

    // simple service methods
    public BlobInfo uploadBlob(String blobName, byte[] content);
    public Response<BlobInfo> uploadBlobWithResponse(String blobName, byte[] content, Context context);

    // complex service methods, note the introduction of the 'CreateBlobOptions' type
    public BlobInfo createBlob(CreateBlobOptions options);
    public Response<BlobInfo> createBlobWithResponse(CreateBlobOptions options, Context context);

    // convenience overload[s]
    public BlobInfo createBlob(String blobName);
}

@Fluent
public class CreateBlobOptions {
    private String blobName;
    private PublicAccessType access;
    private Map<String, String> metadata;

    // Constructor enforces the requirement that blobName is always set
    public CreateBlobOptions(String blobName) {
        this.blobName = blobName;
    }

    public String getBlobName() {
        return blobName;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setAccess(PublicAccessType access) {
        this.access = access;
        return this;
    }

    public PublicAccessType getAccess() {
        return access;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setMetadata(Map<String, String> metadata) {
        this.metadata = metadata;
        return this;
    }

    public Map<String, String> getMetadata() {
        return metadata;
    }
}
✅ DO name the options type after the name of the service method it is used for, such that the type is named <operation>Options. For example, above the method was createBlob, and so the options type was named CreateBlobOptions.
✅ DO use the options parameter pattern for complex service methods.
✔️ YOU MAY use the options parameter pattern for simple service methods that you expect to grow in the future.
✔️ YOU MAY add simple overloads of methods using the options parameter pattern.
If in common scenarios, users are likely to pass just a small subset of what the options parameter represents, consider adding an overload with a parameter list representing just this subset.
⛔️ DO NOT introduce method overloads that take a subset of the parameters as well as the options parameter, except for parameters that are for client-side use only (e.g. Context, timeout, etc).
✅ DO use the options parameter type, if it exists, for all *WithResponse methods. If no options parameter type exists, do not create one solely for the *WithResponse method.
✅ DO place all options types in a root-level models package, to prevent too many root-level packages and to make use of the existing models package used by other model types.
✅ DO design options types with the same design guidance as given below for model class types, namely fluent setters for optional arguments, using the standard JavaBean naming convention of get*, set*, and is*. Additionally, there may be constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments.
✔️ YOU MAY introduce constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments (in a similar manner to required properties on model types).

Service Methods
Service methods are methods that invoke operations on a service. They are commonly found on classes suffixed with Client, but can also be found on other resource classes that are vended by a client.
⛔️ DO NOT use the suffix Async in methods that do operations asynchronously. Let the fact the user has an instance of an ‘async client’ provide this context.
✅ DO prefer the use of the following terms for CRUD operations:
Verb Parameters Returns Comments upsert<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services. set<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service. create<noun> key, item Created item Create new item. Fails if item already exists. update<noun> key, partial item Updated item Fails if item doesn’t exist. replace<noun> key, item Replace existing item Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn’t exist. delete<noun> key Deleted item, or null Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn’t exist. Deleted item may be returned, if service supports it. add<noun> index, item Added item Add item to a collection. Item will be added last, or into the index position specified. get<noun> key Item Will return null if item doesn’t exist. list<noun> Items Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist. <noun>Exists key boolean Return true if the item exists.
☑️ YOU SHOULD remain flexible and use names best suited for developer experience. Don’t let the naming rules result in non-idiomatic naming patterns. For example, Java developers prefer list operations over getAll operations.
One of the Azure Core types is com.azure.core.util.Context, which acts as an append-only key-value map, and which by default is empty. The Context allows end users of the API to modify the outgoing requests to Azure on a per-method call basis, for example to enable distributed tracing.
✅ DO provide an overload method that takes a com.azure.core.util.Context argument for each service operation in sync clients only. The Context argument must be the last argument into the service method (except where varargs are used). If a service method has multiple overloads, only the ‘maximal’ overloads need to have the Context argument. A maximal overload is one that has a full set of arguments. It may not be necessary to offer a ‘Context overload’ in all cases. We prefer a minimal API surface, but Context must always be supported.
getFoo()
getFoo(x)
getFoo(x, y)
getFoo(x, y, z) // maximal overload
getFoo(a)       // maximal overload

// this will result in the following two methods being required
// (replacing the two maximal overloads above)
getFoo(x, y, z, Context)
getFoo(a, Context)
⛔️ DO NOT include overloads that take Context in async clients. Async clients use the subscriber context built into Reactor Flux and Mono APIs.

Naming Patterns
Using a consistent set of naming patterns across all client libraries will ensure a consistent and more intuitive developer experience. This section outlines good practices for naming that must be followed by all client libraries.
✅ DO prefer succinctness over verbosity in method and class names, except when readability is impacted. A few examples include:
A class may want to return an identifier to a user. There is no additional value in the fully-qualified getIdentifier() compared with the shorter and equally-descriptive getId(). A method called getName() is short, but may leave some doubt in the users mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method getLinkName() will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of getId() above, always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use getTenantId() rather than getId(), unless it is completely unambiguous as to which identifier is being referenced.
⛔️ DO NOT fully uppercase acronyms. APIs must take the form of getHttpConnection() or getUrlName() rather than getHTTPConnection() or getURLName().
✅ DO use service-specific acronyms sparingly in API. Whereas most users will accept a method including Http or Url in the name, most users will not know what Sas or Cpk mean. Where possible (without breaking the succinctness over verbosity requirement above), expansion of acronyms, or at the very least sufficient documentation at class and method levels to describe the acronym, must be considered.
✅ DO use the correct naming for ‘host’ vs ‘hostname’. ‘hostname’ is the host name without any port number, whereas ‘host’ is the hostname with the port number.
⛔️ DO NOT use camel case on words that are commonly accepted in their combined form. For example, ‘hostname’ should be spelt as hostname rather than hostName, and ‘username’ should be spelt as username rather than userName.
⛔️ DO NOT name interface types with an ‘I’ prefix, e.g. ISearchClient. Instead, do not have any prefix for an interface, preferring SearchClient as the name for the interface type in this case.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.

Prompt 2: Convenience Wrapper Generation
================================================================================

Context: The following Java SDK methods were flagged as potential candidates for generating convenience wrappers. The accompanying design guidelines outline desired principles for improving developer experience.

Your task:
Your goal is to think like an SDK designer, not a refactorer.
Analyse the methods and guidelines to identify high-level developer goals or workflows that are currently too low-level or fragmented.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand developer intent:
- What real-world task or developer workflow does this SDK enable?
- What steps would a developer typically need to perform manually?
2. Identify friction points:
- Are there repetitive setup steps, parameter redundancies, or multi-call workflows that could be hidden or automated?
3. Design potential convenience wrappers that:
- Represent meaningful user tasks.
- Eliminate multiple low-level method calls or configuration steps.
- Provide sensible defaults or intelligent handling for common cases.
4. Reject shallow wrappers.
- Do NOT propose wrappers that only merge 2-3 existing methods, unless they significantly improve clarity or hide complex logic.
5.  Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped, and the reason for wrapping.

Output format:

public void exampleWrapper() {
    /*
      Combined Methods: methodOne, methodTwo, etc.

Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Make sure that the 'Combined Methods' and 'Reason' comments are in block comments inside of the method, NOT in the Javadocs comment.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
- Quality over quantity. Avoid creating wrapper methods for the sake of it. All wrappers must be justified
- Output the code as raw text. Do NOT put it in a code block with backticks

```
Design Guidelines:
"""
Option Parameters
Service methods fall into two main groups when it comes to the number and complexity of parameters they accept:
Service Methods with simple inputs, simple methods for short Service Methods with complex inputs, complex methods for short
Simple methods are methods that take up to six parameters, with most of the parameters being simple primitive types. Complex methods are methods that take a larger number of parameters and typically correspond to REST APIs with complex request payloads.
Simple methods should follow standard Java best practices for parameter list and overload design.
Complex methods should introduce an option parameter to represent the request payload. Consideration can subsequently be made for providing simpler convenience overloads for the most common scenarios. This is referred to in this document as the ‘options pattern’, and is demonstrated in the code below:
public class BlobContainerClient {

    // simple service methods
    public BlobInfo uploadBlob(String blobName, byte[] content);
    public Response<BlobInfo> uploadBlobWithResponse(String blobName, byte[] content, Context context);

    // complex service methods, note the introduction of the 'CreateBlobOptions' type
    public BlobInfo createBlob(CreateBlobOptions options);
    public Response<BlobInfo> createBlobWithResponse(CreateBlobOptions options, Context context);

    // convenience overload[s]
    public BlobInfo createBlob(String blobName);
}

@Fluent
public class CreateBlobOptions {
    private String blobName;
    private PublicAccessType access;
    private Map<String, String> metadata;

    // Constructor enforces the requirement that blobName is always set
    public CreateBlobOptions(String blobName) {
        this.blobName = blobName;
    }

    public String getBlobName() {
        return blobName;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setAccess(PublicAccessType access) {
        this.access = access;
        return this;
    }

    public PublicAccessType getAccess() {
        return access;
    }

    public CreateBlobOptions setMetadata(Map<String, String> metadata) {
        this.metadata = metadata;
        return this;
    }

    public Map<String, String> getMetadata() {
        return metadata;
    }
}
✅ DO name the options type after the name of the service method it is used for, such that the type is named <operation>Options. For example, above the method was createBlob, and so the options type was named CreateBlobOptions.
✅ DO use the options parameter pattern for complex service methods.
✔️ YOU MAY use the options parameter pattern for simple service methods that you expect to grow in the future.
✔️ YOU MAY add simple overloads of methods using the options parameter pattern.
If in common scenarios, users are likely to pass just a small subset of what the options parameter represents, consider adding an overload with a parameter list representing just this subset.
⛔️ DO NOT introduce method overloads that take a subset of the parameters as well as the options parameter, except for parameters that are for client-side use only (e.g. Context, timeout, etc).
✅ DO use the options parameter type, if it exists, for all *WithResponse methods. If no options parameter type exists, do not create one solely for the *WithResponse method.
✅ DO place all options types in a root-level models package, to prevent too many root-level packages and to make use of the existing models package used by other model types.
✅ DO design options types with the same design guidance as given below for model class types, namely fluent setters for optional arguments, using the standard JavaBean naming convention of get*, set*, and is*. Additionally, there may be constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments.
✔️ YOU MAY introduce constructor overloads for each combination of required arguments (in a similar manner to required properties on model types).

Service Methods
Service methods are methods that invoke operations on a service. They are commonly found on classes suffixed with Client, but can also be found on other resource classes that are vended by a client.
⛔️ DO NOT use the suffix Async in methods that do operations asynchronously. Let the fact the user has an instance of an ‘async client’ provide this context.
✅ DO prefer the use of the following terms for CRUD operations:
Verb Parameters Returns Comments upsert<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services. set<noun> key, item Updated or created item Create new item or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service. create<noun> key, item Created item Create new item. Fails if item already exists. update<noun> key, partial item Updated item Fails if item doesn’t exist. replace<noun> key, item Replace existing item Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn’t exist. delete<noun> key Deleted item, or null Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn’t exist. Deleted item may be returned, if service supports it. add<noun> index, item Added item Add item to a collection. Item will be added last, or into the index position specified. get<noun> key Item Will return null if item doesn’t exist. list<noun> Items Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist. <noun>Exists key boolean Return true if the item exists.
☑️ YOU SHOULD remain flexible and use names best suited for developer experience. Don’t let the naming rules result in non-idiomatic naming patterns. For example, Java developers prefer list operations over getAll operations.
One of the Azure Core types is com.azure.core.util.Context, which acts as an append-only key-value map, and which by default is empty. The Context allows end users of the API to modify the outgoing requests to Azure on a per-method call basis, for example to enable distributed tracing.
✅ DO provide an overload method that takes a com.azure.core.util.Context argument for each service operation in sync clients only. The Context argument must be the last argument into the service method (except where varargs are used). If a service method has multiple overloads, only the ‘maximal’ overloads need to have the Context argument. A maximal overload is one that has a full set of arguments. It may not be necessary to offer a ‘Context overload’ in all cases. We prefer a minimal API surface, but Context must always be supported.
getFoo()
getFoo(x)
getFoo(x, y)
getFoo(x, y, z) // maximal overload
getFoo(a)       // maximal overload

// this will result in the following two methods being required
// (replacing the two maximal overloads above)
getFoo(x, y, z, Context)
getFoo(a, Context)
⛔️ DO NOT include overloads that take Context in async clients. Async clients use the subscriber context built into Reactor Flux and Mono APIs.

Naming Patterns
Using a consistent set of naming patterns across all client libraries will ensure a consistent and more intuitive developer experience. This section outlines good practices for naming that must be followed by all client libraries.
✅ DO prefer succinctness over verbosity in method and class names, except when readability is impacted. A few examples include:
A class may want to return an identifier to a user. There is no additional value in the fully-qualified getIdentifier() compared with the shorter and equally-descriptive getId(). A method called getName() is short, but may leave some doubt in the users mind about which name is being represented. Instead, naming this method getLinkName() will remove all doubt from the users mind, and without substantial additional verbosity. Similarly, in the case of getId() above, always choose to specify the identifier name if there is any likelihood of confusion about which identifier is being referenced. For example, use getTenantId() rather than getId(), unless it is completely unambiguous as to which identifier is being referenced.
⛔️ DO NOT fully uppercase acronyms. APIs must take the form of getHttpConnection() or getUrlName() rather than getHTTPConnection() or getURLName().
✅ DO use service-specific acronyms sparingly in API. Whereas most users will accept a method including Http or Url in the name, most users will not know what Sas or Cpk mean. Where possible (without breaking the succinctness over verbosity requirement above), expansion of acronyms, or at the very least sufficient documentation at class and method levels to describe the acronym, must be considered.
✅ DO use the correct naming for ‘host’ vs ‘hostname’. ‘hostname’ is the host name without any port number, whereas ‘host’ is the hostname with the port number.
⛔️ DO NOT use camel case on words that are commonly accepted in their combined form. For example, ‘hostname’ should be spelt as hostname rather than hostName, and ‘username’ should be spelt as username rather than userName.
⛔️ DO NOT name interface types with an ‘I’ prefix, e.g. ISearchClient. Instead, do not have any prefix for an interface, preferring SearchClient as the name for the interface type in this case.

Return Types
Requests to the service fall into two basic groups: methods that make a single logical request, and methods that make a deterministic sequence of requests. An example of a single logical request is a request that may be retried inside the operation. An example of a deterministic sequence of requests is a paged operation.
The logical entity is a protocol neutral representation of a response. The logical entity may combine data from headers, body, and the status line. For example, you may expose an ETag header as a property on the logical entity. Response<T> is the ‘complete response’. It contains HTTP headers, status code, and the T object (a deserialized object created from the response body). The T object would be the ‘logical entity’.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) for all synchronous service methods.
✅ DO return the logical entity (i.e. the T) wrapped inside a Mono for all asynchronous service methods that make network requests.
Return Response<T> on the maximal overload for a service method with WithResponse appended to the name. For example:
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b);
Foo foo = client.getFoo(a, b, c, context); // This is the maximal overload, so it is replaced with the 'withResponse' 'overload' below
Response<Foo> response = client.getFooWithResponse(a, b, c, context);
For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:
⛔️ DO NOT return headers and other per-request metadata unless it’s obvious which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.
✅ DO provide enough information in failure cases for a developer to take appropriate corrective action, including a message describing what went wrong and details on the corrective actions to take.
