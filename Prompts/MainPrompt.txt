Context: The attached methods were flagged as having potential patterns, and the guidelines were selected as potentially being relevant:

Your task:
1. Evaluate the code to identify abstractables like low level functionality and other areas where convenience could be introduced to improve developer useability.
2. If no patterns are found in certain methods, ignore them.
3. If patterns are found, create wrapper methods that improves developer experience according to the supplied design guidelines.
4. Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped along with a reason for the wrapping.

These wrappers simplify repetitive setup, connection, and error-handling tasks, while retaining all important functionality.
Use descriptive function names aligned with developer goals.
Keep your output concise, readable, and production-grade.
Do not simply restate SDK usage in a new function.
Do not create classes or wrappers that add no abstraction value.

Your outputted wrapper methods must use the following format and structure:
/**
 * JavaDocs to explain what the method does
 */
public void exampleMethod() {
    /* 
      Changes made: e.g. method 1 and method 2 combined
      Reason: Brief explanation of what convenience was added, and how your output adds it.
    */
    // Code here
}


Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
