Context: The attached methods were flagged as having potential patterns, and the guidelines were selected as potentially being relevant:

Your task:
1. Evaluate the code to identify repeated logic, overlapping functionality, or opportunities to combine methods into a single wrapper.
2. If no patterns are found in certain methods, ignore them.
3. If patterns are found, create a wrapper method that improves developer experience according to the supplied design guidelines.
4. Return the generated wrapper code, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped along with a reason for the wrapping.

Notes:
- Do NOT invent new methods beyond what is attached.
- Include input validation and sensible defaults if applicable.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.

Methods:
