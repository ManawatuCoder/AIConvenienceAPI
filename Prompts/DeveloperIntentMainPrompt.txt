Context: The following Java SDK methods were flagged as potential candidates for generating convenience wrappers. The accompanying design guidelines outline desired principles for improving developer experience.

Your task:
Your goal is to think like an SDK designer, not a refactorer.
Analyse the methods and guidelines to identify high-level developer goals or workflows that are currently too low-level or fragmented.
Evaluate the code to identify abstractables like low level functionality and other areas where convenience could be introduced to improve developer useability.

Follow these steps:
1. Understand developer intent:
- What real-world task or developer workflow does this SDK enable?
- What steps would a developer typically need to perform manually?
2. Identify friction points:
- Are there repetitive setup steps, parameter redundancies, or multi-call workflows that could be hidden or automated?
3. Design potential convenience wrappers that:
- Represent meaningful user tasks.
- Eliminate multiple low-level method calls or configuration steps.
- Provide sensible defaults or intelligent handling for common cases.
4. Reject shallow wrappers.
- Do NOT propose wrappers that only merge 2-3 existing methods, unless they significantly improve clarity or hide complex logic.
5.  Return the generated wrapper methods, along with comments stating which methods were wrapped, and the reason for wrapping.

These wrappers simplify repetitive setup, connection, and error-handling tasks, while retaining all important functionality.
Use descriptive function names aligned with developer goals.
Keep your output concise, readable, and production-grade.
Do not simply restate SDK usage in a new function.
Do not create classes or wrappers that add no abstraction value.

Output format:
/**
 * {Brief JavaDoc summary of code.}
 */
public void exampleWrapper() {
    /*
      Changes made: e.g. method 1 and method 2 combined
      Reason: Explain why this wrapper improves developer experience
    */
    // Code here
}


Extra Notes:
- Do NOT create any classes. Your output code should only be wrapper methods.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary, aside from that in the wrapper method comments.
- Make sure that the 'Combined Methods' and 'Reason' comments are in block comments inside of the method, NOT in the Javadocs comment.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
- Quality over quantity. Avoid creating wrapper methods for the sake of it. All wrappers must be justified
- Output the code as raw text. Do NOT put it in a code block with backticks
