Context: You are analyzing the attached codegen methods from a client class, along with a list of Java Azure SDK Design Guidelines headers.

Your tasks:
1. Identify potential patterns across these methods that could be optimized to improve developer experience 
   (e.g. similar operations that could be combined, consistent parameter patterns, repetitive return processing, 
   avoiding low-level data types like byte streams).
2. From the list of guideline headers, select which guidelines are most relevant to the identified methods.

Instructions:
- Only consider patterns relevant to developer convenience. Ignore low-level protocol details.
- Evaluate whether there is any true convenience to be added.
- You will generate wrappers over multiple requests, so any methods you wish to wrap together should be grouped together in your response.
- Each group will be sent as its own prompt alongside the entire list of requested guidelines; Large grouping is acceptable, and can be desireable for reduced LLM costs.
- Duplicates methods through groups are undesireable; Coallescing of groups is preferred to duplicate methods.
- Duplicate guidelines are completely acceptable, it is desired that you have what you need to output quality.
- If no patterns are found, return only the string "no".
- If patterns are found, return a JSON object in the format:

[
  {
    "methods": ["foo", "bar", ...],
    "guidelines": ["Header 1", "Header 3", ...]
  },
  {
    "methods": ["foobar", "baz", ...],
    "guidelines": ["Header 2", "Header 3", ...]
  },
  ...
]

Notes:
- Do NOT include any explanations or commentary.
- Do not put generated code into a class. You must only return the names as requested.
- If there is no real convenience to be added, ignore all steps and return only the word "no".
