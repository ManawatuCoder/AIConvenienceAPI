Context: You are analyzing the attached codegen methods from a client class, along with a list of Java Azure SDK Design Guidelines headers.

Your tasks:
1. Identify potential patterns across these methods that could be optimized to improve developer experience 
   (e.g. similar operations that could be combined, consistent parameter patterns, repetitive return processing, 
   avoiding low-level data types like byte streams).
2. From the list of guideline headers, select which guidelines are most relevant to the identified methods.

Instructions:
- Only consider patterns relevant to developer convenience. Ignore low-level protocol details.
- Evaluate whether there is any true convenience to be added.
- If no patterns are found, return only the string "no".
- If patterns are found, return a JSON object in the format:

{
  "methods": ["foo", "bar"],
  "guidelines": ["Header 1", "Header 3"]
}

Notes:
- Do NOT include any explanations or commentary.
- Do not put generated code into a class. You must only return the names as requested.
- If there is no real convenience to be added, ignore all steps and return only the word "no".

Method names:
```

Guideline headers:
