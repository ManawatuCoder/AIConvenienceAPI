Context: The attached methods were flagged as having potential patterns.
{code}

Here are the design guidelines that you must follow:
{guidelines}

Your task:
1. Evaluate the code to identify repeated logic, overlapping functionality, or opportunities to combine methods into a single wrapper.
2. If no patterns are found in certain methods, ignore them
3. If patterns are found, create a wrapper method that improves developer experience according to the supplied design guidelines.
4. Only return output in the following structured JSON format:
{
  "wrapperName": "<name of wrapper>",
  "wrapperCode": "<compilable code>",
  "combinedMethods": ["method1", "method2", ...],
  "notes": "<optional notes about design decisions>"
}

Notes:
- Do NOT include any explanations or commentary
- Do NOT invent new methods beyond what is attached.
- Include input validation and sensible defaults if applicable.
- Preserve existing functionality of the combined methods.
